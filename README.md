# GitOpsoKat

Kube + Flux gitops for Core media management infrastructure and apps.

The name comes from GitOps on K8S (K-8-s)

Layout inspired by [Flux Example](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-kustomize-helm-example), and lots of
other examples on [awesome-home-kubernetes](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/awesome-home-kubernetes)
